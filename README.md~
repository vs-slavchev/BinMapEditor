# BinMapEditor
A tool for editing tile maps. Save/load as .bin files. Map files are very small in size as the tile IDs are saved as signed bytes. Uses and made to be used with LibGDX. Configure the mapconfig.properties to change the tileset file name, number of tiles in the map (width and height) and the factor by which width and height will be divided and multiplied for saving purposes (10 is enough; it is recommended that width and height are also multiples of 10 in that case).

Use:
- right mouse button to select a tile from the tileset on the left;
- left mouse button to put a selected tile on the map;
- the arrow keys to move the camera and see all parts of your maps;
- 'S' to save your map;
- 'O' to open an existing map;
